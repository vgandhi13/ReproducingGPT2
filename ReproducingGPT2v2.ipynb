        "1. In pytorch you can directly do model.to(device), but for tensors, you need to save them in variable x = x.to(device)\n",
        "2. All tensors in pytorch by default are float32 which 19.5 teraflops on A100. If numbers have fewer bits of representation, it is easier to move them around. We have a finite capacity of bits our GPU can store but in addition to that there is a limitation to the speed with which we can access. Many of deep learning workload memory bounds, so most of tensor cores are idle because they are waiting around for data. So even if we get 60% utilization of hardware, we are doing well\n",
        "3. Most of the computation happens in linear layers. Entire transformer is bunch of matrix multiplicaton. Biggest one is the classifier layer at the top that goes from 768 to 50257. Matrix mult becomes faster by lowering precision\n",
        "4. TF32 is 13 bits lesser in mantissa than FP32. Inputs and outputs are fp32, but internally it switches to tf32 and this increases speed by 8 times, and we cannot tell much difference in the results.\n",
        "5. Numbers like 16 and 32 are good for Batches and Time. But something like 17 is bad.\n",
        "6. Lowering precision in model training typically decreases training time because lower-precision data (like FP16 compared to FP32) allows hardware to perform computations faster, requires less memory bandwidth, and enables higher parallelism—so more operations happen per clock cycle. However, we expect slight less accurate results but empirically this is a worth it tradeoff. Because you can train longer to make up for the precision decrease\n",
        "7. HBM is connected with GPU. GPU is where most calc happens, but it also has some memory. Most of memory is in high bandwidth memory(HBM). These are two separate chips. HBM is off chip. On GPU, there are large number of streaming processor all of which are SM, and this is where lot of the calculations happen. Single SM has 4 quadrants, each has a tensor core, and different subunits where calcs happen. On GPU chips there is L2 cache, but then on the SM in GPU, there is l1 cache,and registers. The way the memory is stored on GPU is quite different from HBM. So, there is meomery inside GUP but it is not a lot of memory.\n",
        "8. Now, even if main memory of computer is very large, it is very inefficient as GPU would have to go through CPU to reach disk, and this is very time intensive. Then GPUs have HBM which are large in memory, but are also expensive to access. Then, on the GPU chips itself everything is very fast, but there is very few memory on it(in MBs as opposed to gbS), but it is lightning fast. So basically whenver, we have these kernels, we take these inputs which live on HBM, we start streaming data to gpu chip, we do computations, and then send it back to HBM. If we dont use torch.compile, we we are doing this HBM->GPU->HBM transfers many more times. But when we use it, since it already know stuff ahead in time, it optimizes data transfer and does all the computations together. So operation fusion, allows to keep chunk of data on chip, do lots of computation, and then do a single transfer back to HBM.\n",
        "9. Flash attention: Fusing matmul, dropout, softmax, mask, and matmul to a fused kernel of flash attention. It is a kernel fusing algorithm torch.compile cannot find, and the reason is algorithmic rewrite of how attention is implemented. Flashattention does more flops(arithmetic ops) than regular attention. But it is significantly faster(7.6x) because very mindful of the memory heirarchy described above. Very mindful about what is in HBM, what is in shared memory. Very careful of how it orchastrates the computation, such that we have a fewer reads and writes with HBM. So even though we are doing more flops, the expensive part is the load and store. The NXN matrix (att in our code), never gets materialized at any point in HBM, and never gets read or written to HBM. For each head,\n",
        "10. It is good to deal with powers of two because that is how cuda works\n",
        "11. When we pass in custom vocab_size=50304, which is > 50257, (to make a an ugly number into a nicer number power of 2 to increase speed), wte becomes larger, but these newer tokens rows/vectors are never used because GPT2 only has 50257 tokens. We will never index into these rows, so wasting a little bit of space. Now, it is share with classifier at the end,  so we are predicting probabilities for tokens that will never be present in the training set and so therefore the network has to learn that these probabilities have to be driven to 0. And so the logits that the network produces have to drive those dimensions of the output to negative infinity. But this is no different to tokens not present in our dataset, ie Shakespeare dataset only uses 1000 of the 50000+ tokens. So functionally nothing breaks, we just use extra memory. It is running faster because many kernels use block tiles which are powers of 2, so calcs done in chunks of 64. When desired calc does not neatly fit into those block tiles, there are all kind of boundary kernels that can kick in to do the last part. In a lot of kernels, they will truncate up your input and will do the nice part first and then they have a whole second phase where they come back to anything that remains and process it, but this could be very inefficient. So instead pad the input, and make it fit nicely.\n",
        "12. According to Andrej, gpt 2 has open weights, but paper does not have much detail for training, for gpt 3, paper has a lot of info, but weights not released. Roughly speaking they are very similar architecturally  , apart from some hyperparameters,context length size, training time, more data\n",
        "13. We make sure length is not more than 1.0. People like to use this gradient norm clipping, because sometimes you can get unlucky with optimization because of bad data batch or something like that. If you get very unlucky in batch you might get really high loss and really high loss could lead to really high gradient and this could basically shock your model and the optimization . So this prevents model from getting too big of shocks in terms of gradient magnitudes. Bit of a hacky solution, patch on top of bigger issues. You can visualize this norm, and if norm of gradient is horizontal, it is well behaved and fine, if it is climbing, things are bad, sometimes you can get spike which is also bad due to training instability. Norm very high in begining as learning a lot of new stuff.\n",
        "14. For context, I trained the model on A100 GPU\n",
        "15. Cosine learning rate that we used here has been popularize by gpt 2 and 3 papers, but there are other learning rate schedules and this is an active area of research.\n",
        "16. We weight decay weights involved in matrix multiplications, embeddings, etc, but not those which are biases, or layer norms, etc. We decay weights, because it is like regularization. when you are pulling down weights all the weights, you are forcing the optimization to use more of the weights and you are not allowing any of the weights to be way too large. You are forcing the network to distribute the work across more channels\n",
        "17. Fused AdamW - Not available by default, need to turn it on when running on cuda. What it does is, instead of running in a for loop over all the paramter tensors and updating them, that would launch a lot of kernels. Fused just means all those kernels are fused into a single kernel, you get rid of a lot of overhead, and you single time on all the parameters call a kernel that updates them. So it is basically a kernel fusion for AdamW update instead of updating all the tensors.\n",
